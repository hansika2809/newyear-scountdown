HEY! this is my very first webpage (after high school) I tried to be little creative with my webpage, when you would open the web page,
you would see a moving lofi girl which currently demostrates my situation , so I have added that on the left panel and on the right panel ,
I have added a countdown  timer after writing few mathematical logics in js for that. It will stop on 1st january 00:00:00 and
then a new webpage will show up with a gif showing happy new year. 
I have added a small preview button on the bottom right corner of the page, if you click on that, it will open into a new web page which contains new year's gif.
